Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

  <ol>
    <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
      <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. LibreOffice comes
      preinstalled with several Linux distributions. If you don't already have it, use
      your package manager to install it: (e.g., <code>sudo apt-get install
	libreoffice</code> for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions).
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
  <br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs
  through a web browser, and any browser - Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer -
  should work fine.  You will need to download Google Refine and install it, and
  when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need an
  internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/tag/2.6-rc.2">download
	page</a>
    <li>Click on <i>openrefine-linux-VERSION.tar.gz</i> to download the install file
    <li>Download and extract
    <li>Type <code>./refine</code> in your terminal and Google Refine will then
    open in your web browser.
    <li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started
      the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should
      see OpenRefine.
  </ul>

<p>

<li><b>Python</b>
  <br>
  Python is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for
  general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific
  packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend Anaconda, an
  all-in-one installer. Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make
  sure you install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine). We will teach Python
  using the Jupyter notebook, a programming environment that runs in a web
  browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The
  current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported
  (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are
  not).
  <ul>
    <li>Open <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads</a> with your web browser.
    <li>Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.
    <li>Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation. (Installation requires using the shell. If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)
    <li>Open a terminal window.
    <li>
      Type: <code>bash Anaconda-</code> and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
    <li>Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down through the text. Type yes and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. Type yes and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
  </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>SQLite</b>
    <br>
    For this workshop we're going to use the Firefox SQLite Plugin. It works through
    the web browser Firefox.
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't already have Firefox installed
	<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">install Firefox</a>
      <li>Start Firefox
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
      <li> Click the "Add Now" button.
      <li> Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
      <li> Restart Firefox when prompted.
      <li> Select "SQLite Manager" from the "Tools" menu and it will open within Firefox
    </ul>
</ol>
